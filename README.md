This repository is for our paper:

[1] HanQin Cai, Jialin Liu, and Wotao Yin. Learned Robust PCA: A Scalable Deep Unfolding Approach for High-Dimensional Outlier Detection. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 2021.

We are organizing the codes now, and will update them before the conference starts.
